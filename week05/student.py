# Write a program that stores a student name and a list of her courses and grades in a dict, 
# the program should then print out her data.
# The number of course she has could change.

# student = {
#     "name":"Mary",
#     "modules": [
#         {
#             "courseName":"Programming",
#             "grade": 45
#         },
#         {
#             "courseName":"History",
#             "grade":99
#         }

# Write a program that will read in the data for the data structure above, 
# ie reads in a studentâ€™s name, then keeps reading in their modules and grades
# (until the user enters a blank module name),
# You can break this up into two parts:
# a. Just read in the module names until the user enters blank,
# b. Then read in the grade as well
# This program can just read in one student (and their module details).
