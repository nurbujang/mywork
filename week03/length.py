# length.py
# Author: Nur Bujang
# to create a program that reads in a string and outputs its length

# input_string=input('Please enter a string:')
# length_of_string=len(input_string)
# print(f'The length of {input_string} is {length_of_string} characters')

# how would you output a string like this?
## John said    "hi"
## I said       "bye"
message='John said\t"hi"\nI said\t\t"bye"'
print(message)
